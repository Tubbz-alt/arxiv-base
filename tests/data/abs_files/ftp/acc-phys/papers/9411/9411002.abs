Title: Order $\hbar$ Corrections to the Classical Dynamics of a Particle with
  Intrinsic Spin Moving in a Constant Magnetic Field

  $O(\hbar)$ effects that modify the classical orbit of a charged particle are
described for the case of a classical spin-1/2 particle moving in a constant
magnetic field, using a manifestly covariant formalism reported previously. It
is found that the coupling between the momentum and spin gives rise to a shift
in the cyclotron frequency, which is explicitly calculated. In addition the
orbit is found to exhibit $O(\hbar)$ oscillations along the axis of the uniform
static magnetic field whenever the gyromagnetic ratio $g$ of the particle is
not 2. This oscillation is found to occur at a frequency $\propto$ $\frac{g}{2}
- 1$, and is an observable source of electric dipole radiation.
