Title: The length of a typical Huffman codeword

  If p is the probability of a letter of a memoryless source, the length l of
the corresponding binary Huffman codeword can be very different from the value
-log p. We show that, nevertheless, for a typical letter, l is approximately
equal to -log p. More precisely, the probability that l differs from -log p by
more than m decreases exponentially with m.
