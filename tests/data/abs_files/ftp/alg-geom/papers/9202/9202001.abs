Title: Rational Curves on Calabi-Yau Threefolds
Authors: Sheldon Katz
Categories: alg-geom math.AG
Comments: 10 pages, AMSLaTeX v1.0 or 1.1. This is a survey talk given at the
  May 1991 Workshop on Mirror Symmetry at MSRI
\\
  The point is to compare the mathematical meaning of the ``number of rational
curves on a Calabi-Yau threefold'' to the meaning ascribed to the same notion
by string theorists.
