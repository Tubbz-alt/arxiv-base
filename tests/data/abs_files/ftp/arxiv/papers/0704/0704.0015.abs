  The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads to
manifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in pure
spinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate these
integrals and then uses them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loop
and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving two and four Ramond
states.
