  We present recent advances in understanding of the ground and excited states
of the electron-phonon coupled systems obtained by novel methods of
Diagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic Optimization, which enable the
approximation-free calculation of Matsubara Green function in imaginary times
and perform unbiased analytic continuation to real frequencies. We present
exact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function
and optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich
polaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and
interacting with phonons hole in the t-J model.
