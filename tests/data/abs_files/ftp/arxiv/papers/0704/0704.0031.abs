  We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of
particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold
distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In
simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the
accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from
the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set
the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton
angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1
microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward
protons at the LHC.
