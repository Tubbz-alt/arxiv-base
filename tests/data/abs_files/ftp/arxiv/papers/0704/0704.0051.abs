Title: Visualizing Teleportation
Authors: Scott M. Cohen
Categories: physics.ed-ph quant-ph
Comments: This is a "teaching" article aimed at making teleportation
  understandable to undergraduate physics majors (and possibly others). Version
  2 has previous appendix moved to early sections, and more clearly states aim
  is to present a way physicists can explain teleportation to non-scientists
\\
  A novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described,
allowing a direct visualization of teleportation of quantum states and
providing a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon.
The discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of explaining
teleportation to non-scientists. The basic ideas of quantum physics are first
explained in lay terms, after which these ideas are used with a graphical
description, out of which teleportation arises naturally.
