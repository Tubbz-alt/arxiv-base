Title: Experimental efforts in search of 76Ge Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay
Authors: Somnath Choudhury

  Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in
non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the
standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of
neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the
process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first
experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence
of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing
efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana
experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed
study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.
