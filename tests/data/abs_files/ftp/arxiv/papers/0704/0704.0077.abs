Title: Universal Forces and the Dark Energy Problem
Authors: Afsar Abbas
Categories: physics.gen-ph
Comments: 9 pages. no figures

  The Dark Energy problem is forcing us to re-examine our models and our
understanding of relativity and space-time. Here a novel idea of Fundamental
Forces is introduced. This allows us to perceive the General Theory of
Relativity and Einstein's Equation from a new pesrpective. In addition to
providing us with an improved understanding of space and time, it will be shown
how it leads to a resolution of the Dark Energy problem.
