  We present a critical review about the study of linear perturbations of
matched spacetimes including gauge problems. We analyse the freedom introduced
in the perturbed matching by the presence of background symmetries and revisit
the particular case of spherically symmetry in n-dimensions. This analysis
includes settings with boundary layers such as brane world models and shell
cosmologies.
