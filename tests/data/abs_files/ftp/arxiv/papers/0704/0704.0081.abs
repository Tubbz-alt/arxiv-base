  We discussed quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz and Poincare algebras. In
the case of Poincare algebra it is shown that almost all classical r-matrices
of S. Zakrzewski classification correspond to twisted deformations of Abelian
and Jordanian types. A part of twists corresponding to the r-matrices of
Zakrzewski classification are given in explicit form.
