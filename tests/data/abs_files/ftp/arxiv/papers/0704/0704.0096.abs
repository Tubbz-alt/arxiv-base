  In this note we present three representations of a 248-dimensional Lie
algebra, namely the algebra of Lie point symmetries admitted by a system of
five trivial ordinary differential equations each of order forty-four, that
admitted by a system of seven trivial ordinary differential equations each of
order twenty-eight and that admitted by one trivial ordinary differential
equation of order two hundred and forty-four.
