Title: On Equivariant Embedding of Hilbert C^* modules
Authors: Debashish Goswami
Categories: math.OA
Comments: revised substantially, by correcting a wrong argument, pointed out by
  an anonymous referee (thanks to him/her for this!)
\\
  We prove that an arbitrary (not necessarily countably generated) Hilbert
$G$-$\cla$ module on a G-C^* algebra $\cla$ admits an equivariant embedding
into a trivial $G-\cla$ module, provided G is a compact Lie group and its
action on $\cla$ is ergodic.
