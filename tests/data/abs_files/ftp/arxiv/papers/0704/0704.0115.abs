  We will prove the relative homotopy principle for smooth maps with
singularities of a given {\cal K}-invariant class with a mild condition. We
next study a filtration of the group of homotopy self-equivalences of a given
manifold P by considering singularities of non-negative {\cal K}-codimensions.
