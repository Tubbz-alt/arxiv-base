  We consider the variation of the surface spanned by closed strings in a
spacetime manifold. Using the Nambu-Goto string action, we induce the geodesic
surface equation, the geodesic surface deviation equation which yields a Jacobi
field, and we define the index form of a geodesic surface as in the case of
point particles to discuss conjugate strings on the geodesic surface.
