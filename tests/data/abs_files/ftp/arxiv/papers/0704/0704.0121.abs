  Starting from the N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and
bifundamental flavors, we apply the Seiberg dual to the first gauge group and
obtain the N=1 dual gauge theory with dual matters including the gauge
singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describe
the intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stable
nonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold
6-plane, we generalize to the case for N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory with
fundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N=1 SU(N_c) x Sp(N_c')
gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly.
