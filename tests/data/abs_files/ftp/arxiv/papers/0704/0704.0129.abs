  In this paper we show that the quotient Aubry set associated to certain
Lagrangians is totally disconnected (i.e., every connected component consists
of a single point). Moreover, we discuss the relation between this problem and
a Morse-Sard type property for (difference of) critical subsolutions of
Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
