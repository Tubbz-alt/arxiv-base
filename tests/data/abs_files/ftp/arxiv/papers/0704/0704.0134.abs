Title: Causal dissipative hydrodynamics for QGP fluid in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: A. K. Chaudhuri
Categories: nucl-th
Comments: Extensively revised version. In the revised version, we have
  discussed the effect of viscosity on (quark) transverse momentum distribution
  and on elliptic flow. It was shown that elliptic flow saturates due to
  non-equilirium correction to the equilibrium distribution function and can
  not be mimicked by ideal dynamics. 15 pages, 16 figures

  In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is
studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are
solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations.
Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the
same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity
profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of
the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as
viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics.
For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal
viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to
non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be
mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.
