  The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the
trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion
electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the
trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic,
gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions
of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which
are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the
trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and
strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field
source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results
show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.
