  Instanton liquid in heated and strongly interacting matter is studied using
the variational principle. The dependence of the instanton liquid density
(gluon condensate) on the temperature and the quark chemical potential is
determined under the assumption that, at finite temperatures, the dominant
contribution is given by an ensemble of calorons. The respective one-loop
effective quark Lagrangian is used.
