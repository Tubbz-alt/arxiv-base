  An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the
structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent
hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a
thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the
known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions
for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the
corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of
this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and
square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation
theory of fluids are briefly addressed.
