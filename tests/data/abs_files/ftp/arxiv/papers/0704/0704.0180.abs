  Some aspects, both experimental and theoretical, of extracting the neutron
skin $\Delta R$ from properties of isovector giant resonances are discussed.
Existing proposals are critically reviewed. The method relying on the energy
difference between the GTR and IAS is shown to lack sensitivity to $\Delta R$.
A simple explanation of the linear relation between the symmetry energy and the
neutron skin is also given.
