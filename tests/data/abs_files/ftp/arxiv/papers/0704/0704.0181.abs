  We investigate the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to design a set of
photonic crystals (PCs) in one and two dimensions. Our flexible design
methodology allows us to optimize PC structures which are optimized for
specific objectives. In this paper, we report the results of several such
GA-based PC optimizations. We show that the GA performs well even in very
complex design spaces, and therefore has great potential for use as a robust
design tool in present and future applications.
