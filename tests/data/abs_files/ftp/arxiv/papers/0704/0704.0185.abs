  We present a program called potfit which generates an effective atomic
interaction potential by matching it to a set of reference data computed in
first-principles calculations. It thus allows to perform large-scale atomistic
simulations of materials with physically justified potentials. We describe the
fundamental principles behind the program, emphasizing its flexibility in
adapting to different systems and potential models, while also discussing its
limitations. The program has been used successfully in creating effective
potentials for a number of complex intermetallic alloys, notably quasicrystals.
