  The groups G_{k,1} of Richard Thompson and Graham Higman can be generalized
in a natural way to monoids, that we call M_{k,1}, and to inverse
monoids,called Inv_{k,1}; this is done by simply generalizing bijections to
partial functions or partial injective functions. The monoids M_{k,1} have
connections with circuit complexity (studied in another paper). Here we prove
that M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are congruence-simple for all k. Their Green
relations J and D are characterized: M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are J-0-simple, and
they have k-1 non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative
part of the Cuntz algebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word
problem over any finite generating set is in P. Their word problem is
coNP-complete over certain infinite generating sets.
