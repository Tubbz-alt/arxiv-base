  We present a theory of transport through interacting quantum dots coupled to
normal and superconducting leads in the limit of weak tunnel coupling. A
Josephson current between two superconducting leads, carried by first-order
tunnel processes, can be established by non-equilibrium proximity effect. Both
Andreev and Josephson current is suppressed for bias voltages below a threshold
set by the Coulomb charging energy. A $\pi$-transition of the supercurrent can
be driven by tuning gate or bias voltages.
