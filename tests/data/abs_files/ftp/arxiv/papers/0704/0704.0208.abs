Title: Some non-braided fusion categories of rank 3
Authors: Tobias J. Hagge and Seung-Moon Hong
Categories: math.GT math.QA
Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures, v2. Many expository improvements based on
  referee feedback, most notably to the proof of the main theorem and the
  section on pivotal structures. Fewer details are left to the reader. A new
  section outlines the structure of the proof of the main theorem and its
  relation to other results in the paper
MSC-class: 57M

  We classify all fusion categories for a given set of fusion rules with three
simple object types. If a conjecture of Ostrik is true, our classification
completes the classification of fusion categories with three simple object
types. To facilitate the discussion we describe a convenient, concrete and
useful variation of graphical calculus for fusion categories, discuss
pivotality and sphericity in this framework, and give a short and elementary
re-proof of the fact that the quadruple dual functor is naturally isomorphic to
the identity.
