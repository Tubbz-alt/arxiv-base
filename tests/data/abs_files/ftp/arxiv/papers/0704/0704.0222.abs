  A new estimation of the gamma-ray flux that we expect to detect from SUSY
dark matter annihilation from the Draco dSph is presented using the DM density
profiles compatible with the latest observations. This calculation takes also
into account the important effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the
telescope. We show that this effect is crucial in the way we will observe and
interpret a possible signal detection. Finally, we discuss the prospects to
detect a possible gamma signal from Draco for MAGIC and GLAST.
