  We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining
`quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to
explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova
explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron
diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense
magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space
approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass
driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD
shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as
compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the
gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.
