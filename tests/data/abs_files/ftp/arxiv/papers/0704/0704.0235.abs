  Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new charged
gauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Such
particles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In
this paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling
helicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery
channel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution,
reconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides
the best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires
integrated luminosities of $\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV
and provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This
helicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various
discovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference
regime, but with higher integrated luminosities.
