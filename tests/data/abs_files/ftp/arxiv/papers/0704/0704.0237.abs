  We describe preliminary results of a global model of the radiatively-driven
photoionized wind and accretion flow of the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1.
The full model combines FLASH hydrodynamic calculations, XSTAR photoionization
calculations, HULLAC atomic data, and Monte Carlo radiation transport. We
present maps of the density, temperature, velocity, and ionization parameter
from a FLASH two-dimensional time-dependent simulation of Vela X-1, as well as
maps of the emissivity distributions of the X-ray emission lines.
