  We analyze the properties of the quasiparticle excitations of metallic
antiferromagnetic states in a strongly correlated electron system. The study is
based on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional
Hubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent
solutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical
renormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then
analyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these
quasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and
also from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found
to be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\bf
k$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle
picture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the total
electron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state.
