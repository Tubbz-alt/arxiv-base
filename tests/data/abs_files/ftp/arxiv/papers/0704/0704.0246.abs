  Here, we present theoretical studies of the temperature and magnetic field
dependences of the Coulomb drag transresistivity between two parallel layers of
two dimensional electron gases in quantum Hall regime near half filling of the
lowest Landau level. It is shown that Fermi-liquid interactions between the
relevant quasiparticles could give a significant effect on the
transresistivity, providing its independence of the interlayer spacing for
spacings taking on values reported in the experiments. Obtained results agree
with the experimental evidence.
