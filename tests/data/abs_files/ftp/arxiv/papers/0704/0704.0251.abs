  We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure that
quantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace.
We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximally
entangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximally
entangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum error
correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show
that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is
a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we
provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we
analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.
