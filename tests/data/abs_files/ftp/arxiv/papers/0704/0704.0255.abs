  We present new predictions for the galaxy three-point correlation function
(3PCF) using high-resolution dissipationless cosmological simulations of a flat
LCDM Universe which resolve galaxy-size halos and subhalos. We create realistic
mock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities and colors to dark matter halos
and subhalos, and we measure the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity and
color in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are
varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the
reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from
the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF
measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We
explore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated
3PCF. The agreement between the model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurements
lends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM
halos and subhalos.
