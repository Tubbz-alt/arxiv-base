  In trigonometric series terms all polyharmonic functions inside the unit disk
are described. For such functions it is proved the existence of their boundary
values on the unit circle in the space of hyperfunctions. The necessary and
sufficient conditions are presented for the boundary value to belong to certain
subspaces of the space of hyperfunctions.
