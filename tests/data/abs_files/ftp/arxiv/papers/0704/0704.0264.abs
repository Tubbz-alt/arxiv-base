Title: Gluon Radiation of an Expanding Color Skyrmion in the Quark-Gluon Plasma
Authors: Jian Dai
Categories: hep-ph hep-th nucl-th
Comments: 8 pages, 3 eps figures
\\
  The density of states and energy spectrum of the gluon radiation are
calculated for the color current of an expanding hydrodynamic skyrmion in the
quark gluon plasma with a semiclassical method. Results are compared with those
in literatures.
