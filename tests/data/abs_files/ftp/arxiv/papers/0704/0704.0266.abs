  While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by the
presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, they
are quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer line
profiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness.
We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric
characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination
angle effects. The increasing number of known "hybrid" SNe with IIn-like
emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around
all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations
between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us
address the question of classification of "interacting SNe" and the possibility
of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass.
