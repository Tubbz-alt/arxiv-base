  We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with
automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for
quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance
variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement.
We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm
suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based
analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of
qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better
layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling
mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of
some area.
