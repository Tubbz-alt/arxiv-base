  We present some numerical results obtained from a simple individual based
model that describes clustering of organisms caused by competition. Our aim is
to show how, even when a deterministic description developed for continuum
models predicts no pattern formation, an individual based model displays well
defined patterns, as a consequence of fluctuations effects caused by the
discrete nature of the interacting agents.
