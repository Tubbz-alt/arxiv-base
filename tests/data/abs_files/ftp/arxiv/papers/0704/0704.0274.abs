  We present a new version of TaylUR, a Fortran 95 module to automatically
compute the numerical values of a complex-valued function's derivatives with
respect to several variables up to an arbitrary order in each variable, but
excluding mixed derivatives. The new version fixes a potentially serious bug in
the code for exponential-related functions that could corrupt the imaginary
parts of derivatives, as well as being compatible with a wider range of
compilers.
