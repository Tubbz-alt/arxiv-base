  We numerically study Barrett-Crane models of Riemannian quantum gravity. We
have extended the existing numerical techniques to handle q-deformed models and
arbitrary space-time triangulations. We present and interpret expectation
values of a few selected observables for each model, including a spin-spin
correlation function which gives insight into the behaviour of the models. We
find the surprising result that, as the deformation parameter q goes to 1
through roots of unity, the limit is discontinuous.
