  Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been detected at GeV energies by EGRET and
models predict emission at > 100 GeV. Milagro is a wide field (2 sr) high duty
cycle (> 90 %) ground based water Cherenkov detector that records extensive air
showers in the energy range 100 GeV to 100 TeV. We have searched for very high
energy emission from a sample of 106 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) detected since the
beginning of 2000 by BATSE, BeppoSax, HETE-2, INTEGRAL, Swift or the IPN. No
evidence for emission from any of the bursts has been found and we present
upper limits from these bursts.
