  Some multipartite quantum states can be generated in a sequential manner
which may be implemented by various physical setups like microwave and optical
cavity QED, trapped ions, and quantum dots etc. We analyze the general N to M
qubits Universal Quantum Cloning Machine (UQCM) within a sequential generation
scheme. We show that the N to M sequential UQCM is available. The case of
d-level quantum states sequential cloning is also presented.
