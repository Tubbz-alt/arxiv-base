  We discuss generic properties of classical and quantum theories of gravity
with a scalar field which are revealed at the vicinity of the cosmological
singularity. When the potential of the scalar field is exponential and
unbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations has
quasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usual
anisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending on
the strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum
gravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field
correlation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with
quasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is
interpreted as the condensation of gravitons.
