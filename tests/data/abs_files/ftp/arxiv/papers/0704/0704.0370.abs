  The generation of oscillations in the microwave frequency range is one of the
most important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting the
spin transfer phenomenon. We report transport and microwave power measurements
on specially designed nanopillars for which a non-standard angular dependence
of the spin transfer torque (wavy variation) is predicted by theoretical
models. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterized
by large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is also
predicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. This
type of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for the
implementation of spin transfer oscillators since they are able to generate
microwave oscillations without applied magnetic field. We also emphasize the
theoretical implications of our results on the angular dependence of the
torque.
