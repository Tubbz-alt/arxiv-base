  We compute exactly the semi-classical radiation spectrum for a class of
non-asymptotically flat charged dilaton black holes, the so-called linear
dilaton black holes. In the high frequency regime, the temperature for these
black holes generically agrees with the surface gravity result. In the special
case where the black hole is massless, we show that, although the surface
gravity remains finite, there is no radiation, in agreement with the fact that
massless objects cannot radiate.
