  The final state interactions (FSI) model in which soft rescattering of low
mass intermediate states dominates is suggested. It explains why the strong
interaction phases are large in the $B_d\to\pi\pi$ channel and are considerably
smaller in the $B_d\to\rho\rho$ one. Direct CP asymmetries of $B_d\to\pi\pi$
decays which are determined by FSI phases are considered as well.
