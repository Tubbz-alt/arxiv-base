  We study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising model
[with a random-exchange probability $P(J_{xy}) = p \delta(J_{xy} - J) + (1-p)
\delta(J_{xy} + J)$] at the transition line between the paramagnetic and
ferromagnetic phase, which extends from $p=1$ to a multicritical (Nishimori)
point at $p=p_N\approx 0.767$. By a finite-size scaling analysis of Monte Carlo
simulations at various values of $p$ in the region $p_N<p<1$, we provide strong
numerical evidence that the critical behavior along the ferromagnetic
transition line belongs to the same universality class as the three-dimensional
randomly-dilute Ising model. We obtain the results $\nu=0.682(3)$ and
$\eta=0.036(2)$ for the critical exponents, which are consistent with the
estimates $\nu=0.683(2)$ and $\eta=0.036(1)$ at the transition of
randomly-dilute Ising models.
