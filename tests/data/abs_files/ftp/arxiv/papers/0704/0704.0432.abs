Title: A Survey of Huebschmann and Stasheff's Paper: Formal Solution of the
  Master Equation via HPT and Deformation Theory
Authors: Fusun Akman and Lucian M. Ionescu
Categories: math.QA
Comments: 24 pages

  These notes, based on the paper "Formal Solution of the Master Equation via
HPT and Deformation Theory" by Huebschmann and Stasheff, were prepared for a
series of talks at Illinois State University with the intention of applying
Homological Perturbation Theory to the derived bracket constructions of
Kosmann-Schwarzbach and T. Voronov, and eventually writing Part II of the paper
"Higher Derived Brackets and Deformation Theory I" by the present authors.
