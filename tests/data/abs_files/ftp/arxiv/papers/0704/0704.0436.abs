  How to effectively solve the eigen solutions of the nonlinear spinor field
equation coupling with some other interaction fields is important to understand
the behavior of the elementary particles. In this paper, we derive a simplified
form of the eigen equation of the nonlinear spinor, and then propose a scheme
to solve their numerical solutions. This simplified equation has elegant and
neat structure, which is more convenient for both theoretical analysis and
numerical computation.
