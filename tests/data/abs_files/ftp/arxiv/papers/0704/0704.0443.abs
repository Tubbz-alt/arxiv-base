  We discuss the possibility to extract the neutron-neutron scattering length
a_{nn} from experimental spectra on the reaction gamma d --> pi^+ nn. The
transition operator is calculated to high accuracy from chiral perturbation
theory. We argue that for properly chosen kinematics, the theoretical
uncertainty of the method can be as low as 0.1 fm.
