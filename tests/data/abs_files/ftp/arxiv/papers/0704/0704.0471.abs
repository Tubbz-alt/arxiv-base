  The density dependence of the symmetry energy in the equation of state of
isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is of significant importance for studying the
structure of systems as diverse as the neutron-rich nuclei and the neutron
stars. A number of reactions using the dynamical and the statistical models of
multifragmentation, and the experimental isoscaling observable, is studied to
extract information on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. It is
observed that the dynamical and the statistical model calculations give
consistent results assuming the sequential decay effect in dynamical model to
be small. A comparison with several other independent studies is also made to
obtain important constraint on the form of the density dependence of the
symmetry energy. The comparison rules out an extremely " stiff " and " soft "
form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy with important
implications for astrophysical and nuclear physics studies.
