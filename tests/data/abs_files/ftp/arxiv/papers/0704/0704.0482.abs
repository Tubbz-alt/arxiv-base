  manipulating environment
Authors: Zhang-qi Yin, Fu-li Li, Peng Peng
Categories: quant-ph
Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures; v2, We have maken considerable changes. New model
  to engineer effective reservoir without broadband squeezing light is
  proposed, which makes the scheme more practical. Main results are not
  changed; v3, accepted for PRA. Change style to PRA

  We consider an atom-field coupled system, in which two pairs of four-level
atoms are respectively driven by laser fields and trapped in two distant
cavities that are connected by an optical fiber. First, we show that an
effective squeezing reservoir can be engineered under appropriate conditions.
Then, we show that a two-qubit geometric CPHASE gate between the atoms in the
two cavities can be implemented through adiabatically manipulating the
engineered reservoir along a closed loop. This scheme that combines engineering
environment with decoherence-free space and geometric phase quantum computation
together has the remarkable feature: a CPHASE gate with arbitrary phase shift
is implemented by simply changing the strength and relative phase of the
driving fields.
