  We measured the correlation of the times between successive flaps of a flag
for a variety of wind speeds and found no evidence of low dimensional chaotic
behavior in the return maps of these times. We instead observed what is best
modeled as random times determined by an exponential distribution. This study
was done as an undergraduate experiment and illustrates the differences between
low dimensional chaotic and possibly higher dimensional chaotic systems.
