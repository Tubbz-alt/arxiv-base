  Because observations of galaxies and clusters have been found inconsistent
with General Relativity (GR), the focus of effort in developing a Scalar
Potential Model (SPM) has been on the examination of galaxies and clusters. The
SPM has been found to be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flow
of IGM from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic redshift
without an expanding universe, discrete redshift, rotation curve (RC) data
without dark matter, asymmetric RCs, galaxy central mass, galaxy central
velocity dispersion, and the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests a
model of past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of the
universe. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the effect of the
Sources and Sinks approximate a flat scalar potential field such as between
clusters and on the solar system scale, which is small relative to the distance
to a Source.
