Title: Long Distance Signaling Using Axion-like Particles
Authors: Daniel D. Stancil
Categories: hep-ph astro-ph hep-th
Comments: 18 pages, including 3 figures Version 2 has been modified to show
  portions of the coupling-mass plane that may lead to long distance
  communication, rather than concentrating on an example using the PVLAS
  parameters

  The possible existence of axion-like particles could lead to a new type of
long distance communication. In this work, basic antenna concepts are defined
and a Friis-like equation is derived to facilitate long-distance link
calculations. An example calculation is presented showing that communication
over distances of 1000 km or more may be possible for $m_{a}< 3.5$ meV and
$g_{a\gamma \gamma} > 5 \times 10^{- 8} {\text{GeV}}^{- 1}$.
