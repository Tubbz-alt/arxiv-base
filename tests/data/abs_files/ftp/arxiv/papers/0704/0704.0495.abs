  Given a remarkable representation of the generalized Pauli operators of
two-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two,
W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also be
associated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective space
over the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2).
An intriguing novelty is the recognition of (uni- and tri-centric) triads and
specific pentads of the Pauli operators in addition to the "classical" subsets
answering to geometric hyperplanes of W(2).
