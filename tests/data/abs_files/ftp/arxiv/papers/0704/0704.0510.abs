  We show that axinos, which are dominantly generated by the decay of the
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles produced from the leptonic $Q$-ball
($L$-ball), become warm dark matter suitable for the solution of the missing
satellite problem and the cusp problem. In addition, $\Omega_b - \Omega_{DM}$
coincidence is naturally explained in this scenario.
