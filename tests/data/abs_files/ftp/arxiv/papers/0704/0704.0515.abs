  We evaluate the Coulomb drag current in two finite-length
Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid wires coupled by an electrostatic backscattering
interaction. The drag current in one wire shows oscillations as a function of
the bias voltage applied to the other wire, reflecting interferences of the
plasmon standing waves in the interacting wires. In agreement with this
picture, the amplitude of the current oscillations is reduced with increasing
temperature. This is a clear signature of non-Fermi-liquid physics because for
coupled Fermi liquids the drag resistance is always expected to increase as the
temperature is raised.
