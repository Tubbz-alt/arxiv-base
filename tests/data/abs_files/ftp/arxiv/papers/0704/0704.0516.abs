  The effects of imperfect gate operations in implementation of Shor's prime
factorization algorithm are investigated. The gate imperfections may be
classified into three categories: the systematic error, the random error, and
the one with combined errors. It is found that Shor's algorithm is robust
against the systematic errors but is vulnerable to the random errors. Error
threshold is given to the algorithm for a given number $N$ to be factorized.
