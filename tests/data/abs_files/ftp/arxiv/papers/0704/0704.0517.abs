  Foods naturally contain a number of contaminants that may have different and
long term toxic effects. This paper introduces a novel approach for the
assessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmacokinetic
properties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic Dietary
Exposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long term consumption data which, for
the moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as the
SECODIP panel in France. A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a
series of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used
as inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to the
presence of methyl mercury in seafood is revisited using this novel approach.
