  As a continuation of Rabei et al. work [11], the Hamilton- Jacobi partial
differential equation is generalized to be applicable for systems containing
fractional derivatives. The Hamilton- Jacobi function in configuration space is
obtained in a similar manner to the usual mechanics. Two problems are
considered to demonstrate the application of the formalism. The result found to
be in exact agreement with Agrawal's formalism.
