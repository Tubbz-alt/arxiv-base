  In this paper we investigate the optimal control problem for a class of
stochastic Cauchy evolution problem with non standard boundary dynamic and
control. The model is composed by an infinite dimensional dynamical system
coupled with a finite dimensional dynamics, which describes the boundary
conditions of the internal system. In other terms, we are concerned with non
standard boundary conditions, as the value at the boundary is governed by a
different stochastic differential equation.
