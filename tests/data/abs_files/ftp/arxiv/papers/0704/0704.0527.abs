  We investigate the large baryon number sector of the Einstein-Skyrme model as
a possible model for baryon stars. Gravitating hedgehog skyrmions have been
investigated previously and the existence of stable solitonic stars excluded
due to energy considerations. However, in this paper we demonstrate that by
generating gravitating skyrmions using rational maps, we can achieve
multi-baryon bound states whilst recovering spherical symmetry in the limit
where B becomes large.
