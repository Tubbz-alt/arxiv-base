  We consider a supersymmetric Bogomolny-type model in 2+1 dimensions
originating from twistor string theory. By a gauge fixing this model is reduced
to a modified U(n) chiral model with N<=8 supersymmetries in 2+1 dimensions.
After a Moyal-type deformation of the model, we employ the dressing method to
explicitly construct multi-soliton configurations on noncommutative R^{2,1} and
analyze some of their properties.
