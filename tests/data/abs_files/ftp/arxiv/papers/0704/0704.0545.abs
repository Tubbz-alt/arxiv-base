  In response to the comment of Kenzelmann and Harris I show how the continuum
theory of spiral multiferroics can be modified to describe general magnetic
orders and discuss why the microscopic mechanism of magnetically-induced
ferroelectricity usually makes such modifications unnecessary. This explains
why the simple model with a single vector order parameter successfully
describes thermodynamics and magnetoelectric properties of many spiral
multiferroics.
