  Triggered by the demand of the IAEA, neutrino physicists in Europe involved
with the Double Chooz experiment are studying the potential of neutrino
detection to monitor nuclear reactors. In particular a new set of experiments
at the ILL is planned to improve the knowledge of the neutrino spectrum emitted
in the fission of 235U and 239Pu.
