  Distances to well-observed Type II-P SNe are determined from an updated
version of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM), based on recent theoretical
models. The new EPM distances show good agreement with other independent
distances to the host galaxies without any significant systematic bias,
contrary to earlier results in the literature. The accuracy of the method is
comparable with that of the distance measurements for Type Ia SNe.
