  We present an extension of the formalism recently proposed by Pepper & Gaudi
to evaluate the yield of transit surveys in homogeneous stellar systems,
incorporating the impact of correlated noise on transit time-scales on the
detectability of transits, and simultaneously incorporating the magnitude
limits imposed by the need for radial velocity follow-up of transit candidates.
New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget
on transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shaped
transits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined.
Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a
steep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when
considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit
the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find
that small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial
velocity signal can be measured with present-day instrumentation in very nearby
(<100 pc) clusters.
