  The star HE 1305-0007 is a metal-poor double-enhanced star with metallicity
[Fe/H] $=-2.0$, which is just at the upper limit of the metallicity for the
observed double-enhanced stars. Using a parametric model, we find that almost
all s-elements were made in a single neutron exposure. This star should be a
member of a post-common-envelope binary. After the s-process material has
experienced only one neutron exposure in the nucleosynthesis region and is
dredged-up to its envelope, the AGB evolution is terminated by the onset of
common-envelope evolution. Based on the high radial-velocity of HE 1305-0007,
we speculate that the star could be a runaway star from a binary system, in
which the AIC event has occurred and produced the r-process elements.
