  We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study aging phenomena and the occurence of
spinglass phases in systems of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles under
the combined influence of dipolar interaction and anisotropy energy, for
different combinations of positional and orientational disorder. We find that
the magnetic moments oriente themselves preferably parallel to their anisotropy
axes and changes of the total magnetization are solely achieved by 180 degree
flips of the magnetic moments, as in Ising systems. Since the dipolar
interaction favorizes the formation of antiparallel chain-like structures,
antiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading to
aging phenomena characteristic for spin-glasses. Contrary to the intuition,
these aging effects are more pronounced in ordered than in disordered
structures.
