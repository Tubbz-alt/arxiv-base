  Let $\Dh$ and $A$ be unital and separable $C^{*}$-algebras; let $\Dh$ be
strongly self-absorbing. It is known that any two unital $^*$-homomorphisms
from $\Dh$ to $A \otimes \Dh$ are approximately unitarily equivalent. We show
that, if $\Dh$ is also $K_{1}$-injective, they are even asymptotically
unitarily equivalent. This in particular implies that any unital endomorphism
of $\Dh$ is asymptotically inner. Moreover, the space of automorphisms of $\Dh$
is compactly-contractible (in the point-norm topology) in the sense that for
any compact Hausdorff space $X$, the set of homotopy classes $[X,\Aut(\Dh)]$
reduces to a point. The respective statement holds for the space of unital
endomorphisms of $\Dh$. As an application, we give a description of the
Kasparov group $KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ in terms of $^*$-homomorphisms and
asymptotic unitary equivalence. Along the way, we show that the Kasparov group
$KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ is isomorphic to $K_0(A\ot \Dh)$.
