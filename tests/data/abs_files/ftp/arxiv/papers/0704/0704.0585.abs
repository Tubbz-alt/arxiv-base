  The inter-Landau level transitions observed in far-infrared transmission
experiments on few-layer graphene samples show a behaviour characteristic of
the linear dispersion expected in graphene. This behaviour persists in
relatively thick samples, and is qualitatively different from that of thin
samples of bulk graphite.
