  We present an algorithm for systematic encoding of Hermitian codes. For a
Hermitian code defined over GF(q^2), the proposed algorithm achieves a run time
complexity of O(q^2) and is suitable for VLSI implementation. The encoder
architecture uses as main blocks q varying-rate Reed-Solomon encoders and
achieves a space complexity of O(q^2) in terms of finite field multipliers and
memory elements.
