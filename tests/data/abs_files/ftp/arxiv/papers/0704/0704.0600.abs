  We introduce a new class of "random" subsets of natural numbers, WM sets.
This class contains normal sets (sets whose characteristic function is a normal
binary sequence). We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for
solvability of systems of linear equations within every WM set and within every
normal set. We also show that partition-regular system of linear equations with
integer coefficients is solvable in any WM set.
