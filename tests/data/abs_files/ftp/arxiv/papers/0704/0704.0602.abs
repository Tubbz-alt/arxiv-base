  We compare the dependences on the number of colors of the leading pion pion
scattering amplitudes using the single index quark field and two index quark
fields. These are seen to have different relationships to the scattering
amplitudes suggested by chiral dynamics which can explain the long puzzling
pion pion s wave scattering up to about 1 GeV. This may be interesting for
getting a better understanding of the large Nc approach as well as for
application to recently proposed technicolor models.
