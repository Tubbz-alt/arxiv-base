  The ``atom diode'' is a laser device that lets the ground state atom pass in
one direction but not in the opposite direction. We examine three-dimensional
effects of that device for arbitrary atomic incidence angles on flat laser
sheets and set breakdown limiting angles and velocities. It is found that a
correct diodic behavior independent of the incident angle can be obtained with
blue detuned lasers.
