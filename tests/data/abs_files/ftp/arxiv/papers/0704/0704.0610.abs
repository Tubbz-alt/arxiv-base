  We investigate the formation of collisionless shocks along the spatial
profile of a gaussian laser beam propagating in nonlocal nonlinear media. For
defocusing nonlinearity the shock survives the smoothing effect of the nonlocal
response, though its dynamics is qualitatively affected by the latter, whereas
for focusing nonlinearity it dominates over filamentation. The patterns
observed in a thermal defocusing medium are interpreted in the framework of our
theory.
