Title: Algorithm for anisotropic diffusion in hydrogen-bonded networks

  In this paper I describe a specialized algorithm for anisotropic diffusion
determined by a field of transition rates. The algorithm can be used to
describe some interesting forms of diffusion that occur in the study of proton
motion in a network of hydrogen bonds. The algorithm produces data that require
a nonstandard method of spectral analysis which is also developed here.
Finally, I apply the algorithm to a simple specific example.
