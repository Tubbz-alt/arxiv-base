  This is a reply report to astro-ph/0604264. We studied heavy element
production in high baryon density region in early universe astro-ph/0507439.
However it is claimed in astro-ph/0604264 that small scale but high baryon
density region contradicts observations for the light element abundance or in
order not to contradict to observations high density region must be so small
that it cannot affect the present heavy element abundance.
  In this paper we study big bang nucleosynthesis in high baryon density region
and show that in certain parameter spaces it is possible to produce enough
amount of heavy element without contradiction to CMB and light element
observations.
