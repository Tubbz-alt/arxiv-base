  We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disk
surrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the
optical, and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkable
property of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme
length asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius,
whereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical to
near-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain
scattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a
large debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in
the Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics
alone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical
perturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115
that shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic
space velocity, and age.
