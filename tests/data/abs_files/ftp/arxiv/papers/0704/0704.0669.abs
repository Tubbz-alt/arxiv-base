Title: Reduced and Extended Weak Coupling Limit
Authors: J. Derezinski and W. De Roeck
Categories: math-ph math.MP
Comments: 39 pages, review article for the conference "Noncommutative harmonic
  analysis" in Bedlewo, Poland, 2006. v1-->v2, corrections in Section 5 and
  changes in notation

  We give an extended review of recent work on the extended weak coupling
limit. Background material on completely positive semigroups and their unitary
dilations is given, as well as a particularly easy construction of `quadratic
noises'.
