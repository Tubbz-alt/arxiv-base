  We begin by reviewing the theory of thermal, neutrino-driven proto-neutron
star (PNS) winds. Including the effects of magnetic fields and rotation, we
then derive the mass and energy loss from magnetically-driven PNS winds for
both relativistic and non-relativistic outflows, including important
multi-dimensional considerations. With these simple analytic scalings we argue
that proto-magnetars born with ~ millisecond rotation periods produce
relativistic winds just a few seconds after core collapse with luminosities,
timescales, mass-loading, and internal shock efficiencies favorable for
producing long-duration gamma-ray bursts.
