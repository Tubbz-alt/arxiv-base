  The polarized neutron scattering in helimagnetic MnSi at low $T$ reveals
existence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in the
magnetic field applied along $<111>$ axis below the first order transition to
the non-chiral ferromagnetic state. This unexpected phenomenon is explained by
the analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the
spin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and
$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition
between the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative sign
means an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to a
destruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered state
below the first order ferromagnetic transition.
