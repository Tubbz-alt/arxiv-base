  This paper is devoted to describe the finite-dimensionality of a
two-dimensional micropolar fluid flow with periodic boundary conditions. We
define the notions of determining modes and nodes and estimate the number of
them, we also estimate the dimension of the global attractor. Finally we
compare our results with analogous results for Navier-Stokes equation.
