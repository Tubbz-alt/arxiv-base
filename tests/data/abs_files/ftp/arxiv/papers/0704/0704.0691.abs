Title: Birth, survival and death of languages by Monte Carlo simulation
Authors: C. Schulze, D. Stauffer, S. Wichmann
Categories: physics.soc-ph
Comments: 24 pages review, draft for Comm.Comput.Phys., plus appendix on
  bilinguality
\\
  Simulations of physicists for the competition between adult languages since
2003 are reviewed. How many languages are spoken by how many people? How many
languages are contained in various language families? How do language
similarities decay with geographical distance, and what effects do natural
boundaries have? New simulations of bilinguality are given in an appendix.
