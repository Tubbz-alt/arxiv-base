  Differential and total cross-sections for photoproduction of gamma proton to
proton pi0 omega and gamma proton to Delta+ omega were determined from
measurements of the CB-ELSA experiment, performed at the electron accelerator
ELSA in Bonn. The measurements covered the photon energy range from the
production threshold up to 3GeV.
