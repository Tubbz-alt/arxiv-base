  We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of a
point mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in
this system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface
density of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,
we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle
motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a
finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these
different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we
investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that
such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy
spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different
from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This
suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of
the orbit via the gravitational waves.
