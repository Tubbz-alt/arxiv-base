  We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic
process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis
(MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this
view we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges
(1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those
for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to
long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we
determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail
has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.
