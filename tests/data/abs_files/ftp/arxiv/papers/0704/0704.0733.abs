  A toroidal trap combined with external time-dependent electric field can be
used for implementing different dynamical regimes of matter waves. In
particular, we show that dynamical and stochastic acceleration, localization
and implementation of the Kapitza pendulum can be originated by means of proper
choice of the external force.
