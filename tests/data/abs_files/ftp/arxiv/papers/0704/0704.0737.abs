  We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario of
hep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we
consider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent in
the presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure at
tree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification of
soft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. We
also comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fibered
Calabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discuss
further checks that need to be performed.
