  Activated dynamics in a glassy system undergoing steady shear deformation is
studied by numerical simulations. Our results show that the external driving
force has a strong influence on the barrier crossing rate, even though the
reaction coordinate is only weakly coupled to the nonequilibrium system. This
"driven activation" can be quantified by introducing in the Arrhenius
expression an effective temperature, which is close to the one determined from
the fluctuation-dissipation relation. This conclusion is supported by
analytical results for a simplified model system.
