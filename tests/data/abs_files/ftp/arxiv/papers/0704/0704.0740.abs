  We investigate the possibility of discriminating between Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with dark matter, by studying the
vertical dynamics of disk galaxies. We consider models with the same circular
velocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the same
disks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and we
construct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeans
equations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. We
found that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much
larger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more
realistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantly
reduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and
Newtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.
