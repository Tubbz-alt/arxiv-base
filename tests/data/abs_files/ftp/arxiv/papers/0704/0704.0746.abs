  We present an original statistical method to measure the visibility of
interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of
low frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobe
structure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is
quadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical
method, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits
the same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic
character of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the
impinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.
