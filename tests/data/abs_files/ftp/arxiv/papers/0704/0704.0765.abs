  Measurements of transport properties of amorphous insulating indium oxide
thin films have been interpreted as evidence of the presence of superconducting
islands on the insulating side of a disorder-tuned superconductor-insulator
transition. Although the films are not granular, the behavior is similar to
that observed in granular films. The results support theoretical models in
which the destruction of superconductivity by disorder produces spatially
inhomogenous pairing with a spectral gap.
