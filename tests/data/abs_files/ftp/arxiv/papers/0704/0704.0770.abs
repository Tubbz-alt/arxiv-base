Title: Chemical Evolution
Authors: Francesca Matteucci
Categories: astro-ph
Comments: 56 pages, Lectures delivered at the XVIII Canarie Winter School on
  "Emission Lines Universe"
\\
  In this series of lectures we first describe the basic ingredients of
galactic chemical evolution and discuss both analytical and numerical models.
Then we compare model results for the Milky Way, Dwarf Irregulars, Quasars and
the Intra-Cluster- Medium with abundances derived from emission lines. These
comparisons allow us to put strong constraints on the stellar nucleosynthesis
and the mechanisms of galaxy formation.
