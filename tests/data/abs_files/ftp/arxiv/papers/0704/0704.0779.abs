  With the anticipated launch of GLAST, the existing X-ray telescopes, and the
enhanced capabilities of the new generation of TeV telescopes, developing tools
for modeling the variability of high energy sources such as blazars is becoming
a high priority. We point out the serious, innate problems one zone
synchrotron-self Compton models have in simulating high energy variability. We
then present the first steps toward a multi zone model where non-local, time
delayed Synchrotron-self Compton electron energy losses are taken into account.
By introducing only one additional parameter, the length of the system, our
code can simulate variability properly at Compton dominated stages, a situation
typical of flaring systems. As a first application, we were able to reproduce
variability similar to that observed in the case of the puzzling `orphan' TeV
flares that are not accompanied by a corresponding X-ray flare.
