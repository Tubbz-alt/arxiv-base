  We explore computationally the formation of tri-layer superlattices as an
alternative approach for combining ferroelectricity with magnetism to form
magnetoelectric multiferroics. We find that the contribution to the
superlattice polarization from tri-layering is small compared to typical
polarizations in conventionalferroelectrics, and the switchable ferroelectric
component is negligible. In contrast, we show that epitaxial strain and
``negative pressure'' can yield large, switchable polarizations that are
compatible with the coexistence of magnetism, even in materials with no active
ferroelectric ions.
