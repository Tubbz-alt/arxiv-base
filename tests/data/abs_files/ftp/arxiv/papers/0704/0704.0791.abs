  We study the spectral and energetics properties of 47 long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.
Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the
spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2
parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the
time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding
parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.
The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu
peak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-
frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated
uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our
homogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a
significant correlation between these two quantities (the "Amati" relation) and
we verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also
fit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to
-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the "Amati" relation of non-Swift
GRBs.
