  We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-light
pseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory
(\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark
mass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar
corresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment
assumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the
staggered ``fourth root trick'' within \schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4
for each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially
quenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea
quarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered
(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially
quenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of
non-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing
the analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in
analyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\to\pi$ and $D\to K$ when the
light quarks are simulated with the staggered action.
