Title: Fundamental solutions for a class of non-elliptic homogeneous
  differential operators
Authors: Brice Camus
Categories: math.AP math.GM
Comments: 15 pages, perhaps to be revised
\\
  We compute temperate fundamental solutions of homogeneous differential
operators with real-principal type symbols. Via analytic continuation of
meromorphic distributions, fundamental solutions for these non-elliptic
operators can be constructed in terms of radial averages and invariant
distributions on the unit sphere.
