  The COsmic Foreground Explorer (COFE) is a balloon-borne microwave polarime-
ter designed to measure the low-frequency and low-l characteristics of dominant
diffuse polarized foregrounds. Short duration balloon flights from the Northern
and Southern Hemispheres will allow the telescope to cover up to 80% of the sky
with an expected sensitivity per pixel better than 100 $\mu K / deg^2$ from 10
GHz to 20 GHz. This is an important effort toward characterizing the polarized
foregrounds for future CMB experiments, in particular the ones that aim to
detect primordial gravity wave signatures in the CMB polarization angular power
spectrum.
