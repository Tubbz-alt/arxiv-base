  This Letter reports on 3-dimensional simulations of Kerr black hole
magnetospheres that obey the general relativistic equations of perfect
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In particular, we study powerful Poynting flux
dominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in the
ergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplified
limit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, the
ergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for
greatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux
that is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of
electromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux
threading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading
the equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central
engine of powerful FRII quasars.
