  We have studied the maser emission from a thin, planar, gaseous ring in
Keplerian rotation around a central mass observed edge-on. The absorption
coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with
the distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q}. We have calculated
position-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different
values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,
these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission
at a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or
outer edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line
of sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).
Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar
to the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy
NGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this object
the absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a
decreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the
inner edge of the ring.
