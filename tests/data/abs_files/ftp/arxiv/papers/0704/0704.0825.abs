  Within the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity, the
electronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the superconducting
state is studied. It is shown that the electron spectrum of bilayer cuprate
superconductors is split into the bonding and antibonding components by the
bilayer splitting, then the observed peak-dip-hump structure around the
$[\pi,0]$ point is mainly caused by this bilayer splitting, with the
superconducting peak being related to the antibonding component, and the hump
being formed by the bonding component. The spectral weight increases with
increasing the doping concentration. In analogy to the normal state case, both
electron antibonding peak and bonding hump have the weak dispersions around the
$[\pi,0]$ point.
