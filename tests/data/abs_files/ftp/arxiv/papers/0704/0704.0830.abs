  Recently, it has been shown that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the
Dresselhaus type in $[110]$ quantum wells can be mathematically removed by a
non-Abelian gauge transformation. In the presence of an additional uniform
magnetic field, such a non-Abelian gauge flux leads to a spin accumulation at
the edges of the sample, where the relative sign of the spin accumulation
between the edges can be tuned by the sign of the Dresselhaus SOC constant. Our
prediction can be tested by Kerr measurements within the available experimental
sensitivities.
