  We study effects of two-flavor color superconductivity on the structure of
strange dwarfs, which are stellar objects with similar masses and radii with
ordinary white dwarfs but stabilized by the strange quark matter core. We find
that unpaired quark matter is a good approximation to the core of strange
dwarfs.
