Title: Counting on rectangular areas
Authors: Milan Janjic
Categories: math.CO
MSC-class: 05A10
\\
  In the first section of this paper we prove a theorem for the number of
columns of a rectangular area that are identical to the given one. In the next
section we apply this theorem to derive several combinatorial identities by
counting specified subsets of a finite set.
