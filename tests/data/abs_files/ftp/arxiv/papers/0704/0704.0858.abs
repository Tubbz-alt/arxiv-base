  This paper presents an experimental study and the lessons learned from the
observation of the attackers when logged on a compromised machine. The results
are based on a six months period during which a controlled experiment has been
run with a high interaction honeypot. We correlate our findings with those
obtained with a worldwide distributed system of lowinteraction honeypots.
