  For efficiency reasons, the software system designers' will is to use an
integrated set of methods and tools to describe specifications and designs, and
also to perform analyses such as dependability, schedulability and performance.
AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) has proved to be efficient for
software architecture modeling. In addition, AADL was designed to accommodate
several types of analyses. This paper presents an iterative dependency-driven
approach for dependability modeling using AADL. It is illustrated on a small
example. This approach is part of a complete framework that allows the
generation of dependability analysis and evaluation models from AADL models to
support the analysis of software and system architectures, in critical
application domains.
