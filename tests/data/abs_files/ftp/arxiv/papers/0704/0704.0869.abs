  We fully elucidate the structure of the hierarchy of the connected operators
that commute with the Markov matrix of the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process
(TASEP). We prove for the connected operators a combinatorial formula that was
conjectured in a previous work. Our derivation is purely algebraic and relies
on the algebra generated by the local jump operators involved in the TASEP.
