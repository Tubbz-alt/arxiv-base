  We are proposing to test experimentally the new idea of Enhanced Optical
Cooling (EOC) in an electron storage ring. This experiment will confirm new
fundamental processes in beam physics and will demonstrate new unique
possibilities with this cooling technique. It will open important applications
of EOC in nuclear physics, elementary particle physics and in Light Sources
(LS) based on high brightness electron and ion beams.
