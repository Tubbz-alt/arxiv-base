  The fundamental knowledge on neutrinos acquired in the recent years open the
possibility of applied neutrino physics. Among it the automatic and non
intrusive monitoring of nuclear reactor by its antineutrino signal could be
very valuable to IAEA in charge of the control of nuclear power plants. Several
efforts worldwide have already started.
