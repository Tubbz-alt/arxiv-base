  Since its launch in 1999, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)
has made over 4600 observations of some 2500 individual targets. The data are
reduced by the Principal Investigator team at the Johns Hopkins University and
archived at the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST). The
data-reduction software package, called CalFUSE, has evolved considerably over
the lifetime of the mission. The entire FUSE data set has recently been
reprocessed with CalFUSE v3.2, the latest version of this software. This paper
describes CalFUSE v3.2, the instrument calibrations upon which it is based, and
the format of the resulting calibrated data files.
