  We consider the density of two-dimensional critical percolation clusters,
constrained to touch one or both boundaries, in infinite strips, half-infinite
strips, and squares, as well as several related quantities for the infinite
strip. Our theoretical results follow from conformal field theory, and are
compared with high-precision numerical simulation. For example, we show that
the density of clusters touching both boundaries of an infinite strip of unit
width (i.e. crossing clusters) is proportional to $(\sin \pi
y)^{-5/48}\{[\cos(\pi y/2)]^{1/3} +[\sin (\pi y/2)]^{1/3}-1\}$.
  We also determine numerically contours for the density of clusters crossing
squares and long rectangles with open boundaries on the sides, and compare with
theory for the density along an edge.
