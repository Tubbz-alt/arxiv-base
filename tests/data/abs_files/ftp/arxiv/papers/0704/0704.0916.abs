  The energy spectra of neutrons, protons, and alpha-particles have been
measured from the d+59Co and 3He+58Fe reactions leading to the same compound
nucleus, 61$Ni. The experimental cross sections have been compared to
Hauser-Feshbach model calculations using different input level density models.
None of them have been found to agree with experiment. It manifests the serious
problem with available level density parameterizations especially those based
on neutron resonance spacings and density of discrete levels. New level
densities and corresponding Fermi-gas parameters have been obtained for
reaction product nuclei such as 60Ni,60Co, and 57Fe.
