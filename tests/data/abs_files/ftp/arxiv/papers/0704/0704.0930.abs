  We construct a class of analytic solutions of WZW-type open superstring field
theory describing marginal deformations of a reference D-brane background. The
deformations we consider are generated by on-shell vertex operators with
vanishing operator products. The superstring solution exhibits an intriguing
duality with the corresponding marginal solution of the {\it bosonic} string.
In particular, the superstring problem is ``dual'' to the problem of
re-expressing the bosonic marginal solution in pure gauge form. This represents
the first nonsingular analytic solution of open superstring field theory.
