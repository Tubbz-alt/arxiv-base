  We derive quasiclassical expressions for the three-body decay width and
define the ``preexponential'' coefficients for them. The derivation is based on
the integral formulae for the three-body width obtained in the semianalytical
approach with simplified three-body Hamiltonian [L.V. Grigorenko and M.V.\
Zhukov, arXiv:0704.0920v1]. The model is applied to the decays of the first
excited $3/2^{-}$ state of $^{17}$Ne and $3/2^{-}$ ground state of $^{45}$Fe.
Various qualitative aspects of the model and relations with the other
simplified approaches to the three-body decays are discussed.
