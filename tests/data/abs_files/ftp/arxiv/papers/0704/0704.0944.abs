  We discuss the possibility of GLAST detecting gamma-rays from the
annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the Galactic halo. We have used "Via
Lactea", currently the highest resolution simulation of Galactic cold dark
matter substructure, to quantify the contribution of subhalos to the
annihilation signal. We present a simulated allsky map of the expected
gamma-ray counts from dark matter annihilation, assuming standard values of
particle mass and cross section. In this case GLAST should be able to detect
the Galactic center and several individual subhalos.
