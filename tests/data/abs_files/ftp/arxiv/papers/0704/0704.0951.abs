  Using strong-disorder renormalization group, numerical exact diagonalization,
and quantum Monte Carlo methods, we revisit the random antiferromagnetic XXZ
spin-1/2 chain focusing on the long-length and ground-state behavior of the
average time-independent spin-spin correlation function C(l)=\upsilon
l^{-\eta}. In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent)
power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by
the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3,
otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder
dependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e =
-1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The
origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the
renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered.
Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average
entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal.
The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface
terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our
results by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties,
interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors.
