  We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes from
their near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the
gravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black
holes as well. These charges are shown to be equivalent to the U(1) charges of
appropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are
provided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal
gauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black hole
solutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and their
relations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of the
near-horizon geometry. We relate our results to the entropy function formalism.
