  We review the current status of the theoretical pentaquark search from the
direct QCD calculation. The works from the QCD sum rule and the lattice QCD in
the literature are carefully examined. The importance of the framework which
can distinguish the exotic pentaquark state (if any) from the NK scattering
state is emphasized.
