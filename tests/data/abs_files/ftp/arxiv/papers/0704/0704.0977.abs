  Using the molecular dynamics simulations and the force constant model we have
studied the Raman-active tangential modes (TMs) of a (10, 0) single-wall carbon
nanotube (SWNT) under hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, the
atomic motions in the three TMs present obvious diversities. The pressure
derivative of E1g, A1g, and E2g mode frequency shows an increased value (), a
constant value (), and a negative value () above 5.3 GPa, respectively. The
intrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence of
the experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMs
frequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h to
D2h then to C2h.
