  We demonstrate a scheme for quantum communication between the ends of an
array of coupled cavities. Each cavity is doped with a single two level system
(atoms or quantum dots) and the detuning of the atomic level spacing and
photonic frequency is appropriately tuned to achieve photon blockade in the
array. We show that in such a regime, the array can simulate a dual rail
quantum state transfer protocol where the arrival of quantum information at the
receiving cavity is heralded through a fluorescence measurement. Communication
is also possible between any pair of cavities of a network of connected
cavities.
