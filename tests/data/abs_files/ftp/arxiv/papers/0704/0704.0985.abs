  Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing
complexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel
techniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot
of attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems
can be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal
systems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the
system predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An
embedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our
method aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and
autonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this
architecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.
