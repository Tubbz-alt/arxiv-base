  We consider the interpretation of tetrad fields as reference frames in
spacetime. Reference frames may be characterized by an antisymmetric
acceleration tensor, whose components are identified as the inertial
accelerations of the frame (the translational acceleration and the frequency of
rotation of the frame). This tensor is closely related to
gravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct the set of tetrad fields
adapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, and
show that the gravitational energy-momentum constructed out of this set of
tetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general
relatrivity, vanishes. This result is in agreement with the principle of
equivalence, and may be taken as a condition for a viable definition of
gravitational energy.
