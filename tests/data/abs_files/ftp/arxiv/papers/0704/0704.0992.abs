  We observe that the radial gauge can be consistently imposed \emph{together}
with the Lorenz gauge in Maxwell theory, and with the harmonic traceless gauge
in linearized general relativity. This simple observation has relevance for
some recent developments in quantum gravity where the radial gauge is
implicitly utilized.
