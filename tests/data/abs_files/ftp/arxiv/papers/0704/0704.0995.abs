  We study the question of whether a composite structure of elementary
particles, with a length scale $1/\Lambda$, can leave observable effects of
non-locality and causality violation at higher energies (but $\lesssim
\Lambda$). We formulate a model-independent approach based on
Bogoliubov-Shirkov formulation of causality. We analyze the relation between
the fundamental theory (of finer constituents) and the derived theory (of
composite particles). We assume that the fundamental theory is causal and
formulate a condition which must be fulfilled for the derived theory to be
causal. We analyze the condition and exhibit possibilities which fulfil and
which violate the condition. We make comments on how causality violating
amplitudes can arise.
