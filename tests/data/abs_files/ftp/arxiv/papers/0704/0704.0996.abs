  Five dimensional neutral rotating black rings are described from a
Randall-Sundrum brane world perspective in the bulk black string framework. To
this end we consider a rotating black string extension of a five dimensional
black ring into the bulk of a six dimensional Randall-Sundrum brane world with
a single four brane. The bulk solution intercepts the four brane in a five
dimensional black ring with the usual curvature singularity on the brane. The
bulk geodesics restricted to the plane of rotation of the black ring are
constructed and their projections on the four brane match with the usual black
ring geodesics restricted to the same plane. The asymptotic nature of the bulk
geodesics are elucidated with reference to a bulk singularity at the AdS
horizon. We further discuss the description of a brane world black ring as a
limit of a boosted bulk black 2 brane with periodic identification.
