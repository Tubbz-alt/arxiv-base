  A \emph{binary tanglegram} is a drawing of a pair of rooted binary trees
whose leaf sets are in one-to-one correspondence; matching leaves are connected
by inter-tree edges. For applications, for example, in phylogenetics, it is
essential that both trees are drawn without edge crossings and that the
inter-tree edges have as few crossings as possible. It is known that finding a
tanglegram with the minimum number of crossings is NP-hard and that the problem
is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to that number.
  We prove that under the Unique Games Conjecture there is no constant-factor
approximation for binary trees. We show that the problem is NP-hard even if
both trees are complete binary trees. For this case we give an $O(n^3)$-time
2-approximation and a new, simple fixed-parameter algorithm. We show that the
maximization version of the dual problem for binary trees can be reduced to a
version of MaxCut for which the algorithm of Goemans and Williamson yields a
0.878-approximation.
