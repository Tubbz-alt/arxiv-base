  In the recent paper arXiv:0906.1725 it has been guessed that a ``correct''
treatment of the semi-classical tunneling based on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
gives the standard Hawking formula, contrary to was asserted in my previous
paper arXiv:0904.4572. Here I confirm my calculation showing where the article
of Di Criscienzo et al. is wrong.
