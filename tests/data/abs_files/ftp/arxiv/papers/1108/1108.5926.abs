  Motivated by the recent works of us [1], we establish a correspondence
between f(R)-gravity with the power-law entropy corrected holographic dark
energy (PLECHDE) and new agegraphic dark energy (PLECNADE) models. We
reconstruct corresponding f(R)-gravities and obtain the equation of state
parameters. We show that the selected f(R)-gravity models can accommodate the
transition from the quintessence state to the phantom regime as indicated by
the recent observations.
