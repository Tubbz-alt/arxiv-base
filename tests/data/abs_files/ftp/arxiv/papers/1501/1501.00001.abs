  In some games, additional information hurts a player, e.g., in games with
first-mover advantage, the second-mover is hurt by seeing the first-mover's
move. What are the conditions for a game to have such negative "value of
information" for a player? Can a game have negative value of information for
all players? To answer such questions, we generalize the definition of marginal
utility of a good (to a player in a decision scenario) to define the marginal
utility of a parameter vector specifying a game (to a player in that game).
Doing this requires a cardinal information measure; for illustration we use
Shannon measures. The resultant formalism reveals a unique geometry underlying
every game. It also allows us to prove that generically, every game has
negative value of information, unless one imposes a priori constraints on the
game's parameter vector. We demonstrate these and related results numerically,
and discuss their implications.
