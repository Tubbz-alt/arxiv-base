  This article focuses on the development of the method for the genetic
classification of agamospermous reproduction types in plants using sugar beet
as an example. The classification feasibility is ensured by the use of isozymes
as genetic markers allowing the identification of all three phenotypic classes
in the progeny of individual heterozygous diploid plant and is based on
different phenotypic class ratios in the progenies obtained by meiotic and
mitotic agamospermy. The data indicate that for sugar beet meiotic agamospermy
is the more typical since 13 of 15 explored progenies were classified as those
produced by meiotic agamospermy and only 2 as produced by mitotic agamospermy.
