  We show that the baryonic oscillations expected in the galaxy power spectrum
may be used as a "standard cosmological ruler'' to facilitate accurate
measurement of the cosmological equation of state. Our approach involves a
straight-forward measurement of the oscillation "wavelength'' in Fourier space,
which is fixed by fundamental linear physics in the early Universe and hence is
highly model-independent. We quantify the ability of future large-scale galaxy
redshift surveys with mean redshifts z~1 and z~3 to delineate the baryonic
peaks in the power spectrum, and derive corresponding constraints on the
parameter w describing the equation of state of the dark energy. For example, a
survey of three times the Sloan volume at z ~ 1 can produce a measurement with
accuracy dw ~ 0.1. We suggest that this method of measuring the dark energy
powerfully complements other probes such as Type Ia supernovae, and suffers
from a different (and arguably less serious) set of systematic uncertainties.
