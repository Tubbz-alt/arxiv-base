  We consider a spin 1/2 charged particle on the Lobachevsky plane subjected to
a magnetic field corresponding to a discrete system of Aharonov-Bohm solenoids.
Let $H^+$ and $H^-$ be the two components of the Pauli operator for spin up and
down, respectively. We show that neither $H^+$ nor $H^-$ has a zero mode if the
number of solenoids is finite. On the other hand, a construction is described
of an infinite periodic system of solenoids for which either $H^+$ or $H^-$ has
zero modes depending on the value of the flux carried by the solenoids.
