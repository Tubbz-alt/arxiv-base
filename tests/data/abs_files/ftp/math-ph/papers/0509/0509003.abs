Title: BEC of Free Bosons on Networks
Authors: Taku Matsui
Categories: math-ph math.MP
MSC-class: 82B10
\\
  We consider free Bosons hopping on a network(infinite graph). The condition
for Bose-Einstein condensation is given in terms of the random walk on a graph.
In case of periodic lattices, we also consider Boson moving in an external
periodic potential and obatined the criterion for Bose-Einstein condensation.
