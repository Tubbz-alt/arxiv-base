  The probability that a point is to one side of a curve in Schramm-Loewner
evolution (SLE) can be obtained alternatively using boundary conformal field
theory (BCFT). We extend the BCFT approach to treat two curves, forming, for
example, the left and right boundaries of a cluster. This proves to correspond
to a generalisation to SLE(kappa,rho), with rho=2. We derive the probabilities
that a given point lies between two curves or to one side of both. We find
analytic solutions for the cases kappa=0,2,4,8/3,8. The result for kappa=6
leads to predictions for the current distribution at the plateau transition in
the semiclassical approximation to the quantum Hall effect.
