Title: Kinetic equation and clipping - two limits of wave turbulence theory
Authors: E. Kartashova
Categories: math-ph math.MP
Comments: Text consists of 17 pages. Results of numeric simulations, described
  in text, can also be obtained from author in the form of corresponding
  figures (I could not download them together with the text)

  Different dynamics, described by kinetic equation and clipping method is
shown as well as a role of approximate resonances in wave turbulence theory.
Applications of clipping method are sketched for gravity-capillary and drift
waves. Brief discussion of possible transition from continuous spectrum (=
kinetic equation) to discrete spectrum (= clipping) is given at the end.
