  Scattering of photons at an atom with a dynamical nucleus is studied on the
subspace of states of the system with a total energy below the threshold for
ionization of the atom (Rayleigh scattering). The kinematics of the electron
and the nucleus is chosen to be non-relativistic, and their spins are
neglected. In a simplified model of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion
interacting with the quantized radiation field in which the helicity of photons
is neglected and the interactions between photons and the electron and nucleus
are turned off at very high photon energies and at photon energies below an
arbitrarily small, but fixed energy (infrared cutoff), asymptotic completeness
of Rayleigh scattering is established rigorously. On the way towards proving
this result, it is shown that, after coupling the electron and the nucleus to
the photons, the atom still has a stable ground state, provided its center of
mass velocity is smaller than the velocity of light; but its excited states are
turned into resonances. The proof of asymptotic completeness then follows from
extensions of a positive commutator method and of propagation estimates for the
atom and the photons developed in previous papers.
  The methods developed in this paper can be extended to more realistic models.
It is, however, not known, at present, how to remove the infrared cutoff.
