  The U(1) Calogero Sutherland Model with anti-periodic boundary condition is
studied. The Hamiltonian is reduced to a convenient form by similarity
transformation. The matrix representation of the Hamiltonian acting on a
partially ordered state space is obtained in an upper triangular form.
Consequently the diagonal elements become the energy eigenvalues. The
eigenstates are constructed using Young diagram and represented in terms of
Jack symmetric polynomials. The eigenstates so obtained are orthonormalized.
