  This paper is concerned with the diffraction of an electromagnetic wave by a
perfectly conducting half-plane in a homogeneous bi-isotropic medium
(asymptotically). Similar analysis in a source-free field is done in Asghar,S.
and Lakhtakia, A., (1994), Plane-wave diffraction by a perfectly conducting
half-plane in a homogeneous bi-isotropic medium. Int. J Appl. Electromagnetics
in materials,5,(1994), 181-188. In this paper attention is focused on the wave
coming from a line source.
  The objective is to study the scattering of an electromagnetic wave from the
boundary of a half-plane and thereby to provide a theoretical framework for the
line source diffraction asymptotically. In far field approximation it is shown
that an incident wave coming from a line source behaves like a plane wave. The
scattered field is calculated by using the Fourier transform and the
Wiener-Hopf techniques. The scattered field in the far zone is determined by
using contour integration.
