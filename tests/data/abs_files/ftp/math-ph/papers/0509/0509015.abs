  In this article, we describe the construction of graded $q$-differential
algebra with ternary differential satisfying the property $d^3=0$ and the
$q$-Leibniz rule. Our starting point is coordinate first order differential
calculus on some complex algebra and the corresponding bimodule of second order
differentials.
