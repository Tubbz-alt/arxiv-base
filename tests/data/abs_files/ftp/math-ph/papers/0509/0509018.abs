Title: Braided products for quantum spaces
Authors: Hartmut Wachter

  Attention is focused on quantum spaces of physical importance, i.e. Manin
plane, q-deformed Euclidean space in three or four dimensions as well as
q-deformed Minkowski space. There are algebra isomorphisms that allow to
identify quantum spaces with commutative coordinate algebras. This observation
enables the realization of braiding mappings on commutative algebras. The aim
of the article is to perform this task explicitly, leading us to formulae for
so-called braided products.
