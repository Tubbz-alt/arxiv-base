  We consider the 2D Landau Hamiltonian $H$ perturbed by a random alloy-type
potential, and investigate the Lifshitz tails, i.e. the asymptotic behavior of
the corresponding integrated density of states (IDS) near the edges in the
spectrum of $H$. If a given edge coincides with a Landau level, we obtain
different asymptotic formulae for power-like, exponential sub-Gaussian, and
super-Gaussian decay of the one-site potential. If the edge is away from the
Landau levels, we impose a rational-flux assumption on the magnetic field,
consider compactly supported one-site potentials, and formulate a theorem which
is analogous to a result obtained in the case of a vanishing magnetic field.
