  We present an informal review of results on asymptotics of orthogonal
polynomials, stressing their spectral aspects and similarity in two cases
considered. They are polynomials orthonormal on a finite union of disjoint
intervals with respect to the Szego weight and polynomials orthonormal on R
with respect to varying weights and having the same union of intervals as the
set of oscillations of asymptotics. In both cases we construct double infinite
Jacobi matrices with generically quasiperiodic coefficients and show that each
of them is an isospectral deformation of another. Related results on asymptotic
eigenvalue distribution of a class of random matrices of large size are also
shortly discussed.
