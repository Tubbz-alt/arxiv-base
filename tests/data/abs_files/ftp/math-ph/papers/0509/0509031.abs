  Geometrical optics is extended so as to provide a model for spinning light
rays via the coadjoint orbits of the Euclidean group characterized by color and
spin. This leads to a theory of ``geometrical spinoptics'' in refractive media.
Symplectic scattering yields generalized Snell-Descartes laws that include the
recently discovered optical Hall effect.
