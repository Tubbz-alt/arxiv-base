  The Lie algebra $sl(3,\C)$ is considered in the basis of generalized Pauli
matrices. Corresponding grading is the Pauli grading here. It is one of the
four gradings of the algebra which cannot be further refined.
  The set $\es$ of 48 contraction equations for 24 contraction parameters is
solved. Our main tools are the symmetry group of the Pauli grading of
$sl(3,\C)$, which is essentially the finite group $SL(2,\Z_3)$, and the induced
symmetry of the system $\es$. A list of all equivalence classes of solutions of
the contraction equations is provided. Among the solutions, 175 equivalence
classes are non-parametric and 13 solutions depend on one or two continuous
parameters, providing a continuum of equivalence classes and subsequently
continuum of non-isomorphic Lie algebras.
  Solutions of the contraction equations of Pauli graded $sl(3,\bC)$ are
identified here as specific solvable Lie algebras of dimensions up to 8.
Earlier algorithms for identification of Lie algebras, given by their structure
constants, had to be made more efficient in order to distinguish non-isomorphic
Lie algebras encountered here.
  Resulting Lie algebras are summarized in tabular form. There are 88
indecomposable solvable Lie algebras of dimension 8, 77 of them being
nilpotent. There are 11 infinite sets of parametric Lie algebras which still
deserve further study.
