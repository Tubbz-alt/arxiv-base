  Jack polynomials in superspace, orthogonal with respect to a
``combinatorial'' scalar product, are constructed. They are shown to coincide
with the Jack polynomials in superspace, orthogonal with respect to an
``analytical'' scalar product, introduced in hep-th/0209074 as eigenfunctions
of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical many-body problem. The results of this
article rely on generalizing (to include an extra parameter) the theory of
classical symmetric functions in superspace developed recently in
math.CO/0509408
